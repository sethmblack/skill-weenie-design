# Weenie Design

Create magnetic pull in any experience by identifying or designing "weenies" - visual or conceptual elements that draw people forward, borrowed from Walt Disney's theme park design philosophy.

---

## When to Use

- Users aren't engaging or progressing through an experience
- Designing physical spaces, digital products, or presentations
- Need to create desire to explore or continue
- Onboarding flows where users drop off
- Marketing that needs stronger hooks
- Any journey where motivation needs engineering
- Request for "what's the hook?" or "how do we draw them in?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| experience | Yes | The space, product, or journey to analyze |
| problem | No | Specific engagement problem to solve |
| audience | No | Who needs to be drawn forward |
| current_state | No | Existing attraction elements (if any) |

## The Weenie Philosophy

Disney learned from watching hot dog vendors lead dogs with a dangling wiener. The same principle applies to human motivation - we move toward what attracts us.

"I learned this from the hot dog vendors - you need a weenie to pull people along. In our parks, every land has something that makes you want to walk toward it."

### Disney Examples

| Space | Weenie | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Main Street USA | Cinderella Castle | Pulls guests down the street |
| Fantasyland | The Matterhorn | Creates desire to explore that direction |
| EPCOT entrance | Spaceship Earth | Iconic draw visible from parking lot |
| Animal Kingdom | Tree of Life | Central pull point for the park |

### Weenie Characteristics

1. **Visible from a distance** - You see it before you reach it
2. **Larger than expected** - Scale creates desire
3. **Promises something** - Suggests a reward or experience
4. **Unique** - Stands out from surroundings
5. **Emotionally resonant** - Connects to desires or memories

---

## The Weenie Framework

### Step 1: Map the Journey

Identify where users are and where they need to go:

| Point | Location | Current Motivation | Desired Action |
|-------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Entry | [Where they arrive] | [Why they're here] | [What we want them to do first] |
| Point 2 | [Next location] | [Why continue?] | [Desired next step] |
| Point 3 | [And so on...] | ... | ... |

### Step 2: Identify Motivation Gaps

Where does natural motivation run out? Where do people drop off, hesitate, or get lost?

**Diagnostic questions:**
- Where do users stop progressing?
- Where does confusion appear?
- Where does the path feel unclear?
- Where is the "why continue?" weakest?

### Step 3: Design Weenies

For each motivation gap, design or identify a weenie:

**Physical weenies:** Visible landmarks, architectural elements, visual magnets
**Digital weenies:** UI elements that promise value, preview content, progress indicators
**Conceptual weenies:** Curiosity gaps, promised rewards, social proof
**Temporal weenies:** Countdowns, upcoming events, anticipation builders

### Step 4: Engineer Sight Lines

Weenies only work if people see them. Control what's visible:

- **Reveal timing:** When should the weenie become visible?
- **Obstruction removal:** What's blocking the view?
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show more as they approach
- **Forced perspective:** Make it appear larger/closer than reality

### Step 5: Validate Pull Strength

Test whether weenies create actual motivation:

- Would YOU walk toward this?
- Is it visible from the right distance?
- Does it promise something compelling?
- Is it differentiated from surroundings?
- Does it create curiosity or desire?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Weenie Types by Context

### Physical Spaces
- **Architectural weenies:** Towers, unique structures, scale
- **Lighting weenies:** Illuminated focal points, color draws
- **Kinetic weenies:** Movement, animation, activity
- **Sensory weenies:** Sounds, smells, textures that draw

### Digital Products
- **Content weenies:** Preview of what's inside, teasers
- **Progress weenies:** Indicators of what's ahead, completion status
- **Social weenies:** Activity indicators, social proof, user presence
- **Reward weenies:** Visible achievements, unlocks, benefits
- **Curiosity weenies:** Partial information, questions, mysteries

### Presentations/Pitches
- **Promise weenies:** "By the end, you'll know..."
- **Story weenies:** Character introduced early, resolution promised
- **Data weenies:** Surprising stat teased, explained later
- **Demo weenies:** "Let me show you something" preview

### Marketing/Campaigns
- **Benefit weenies:** Clear outcome visualization
- **FOMO weenies:** Limited time, exclusive access
- **Proof weenies:** Results, testimonials, before/after
- **Curiosity weenies:** "The one thing most people miss..."

---

## Constraints

- Weenies must deliver on their promise - bait-and-switch destroys trust
- Not everything should be a weenie - too many dilutes attention
- Weenies need sight lines - a hidden weenie isn't a weenie
- Scale matters - small weenies get lost in noise
- Cultural context affects what attracts - know your audience
- Weenies can wear out - novelty matters

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No clear motivation gaps | Observe actual user behavior; gaps often hidden |
| Weenie isn't working | Check sight lines, scale, promise clarity |
| Too many competing weenies | Establish hierarchy; one primary per zone |
| Weenie attracts wrong audience | Refine the promise to filter appropriately |
| Can't create physical weenie | Use conceptual/temporal weenies instead |

2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our SaaS onboarding has a 40% completion rate. Users sign up but never finish setup. Help us design weenies."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Weenie Design: SaaS Onboarding Flow

### Journey Map

| Point | Location | Current Motivation | Gap? | Desired Action |
|-------|----------|-------------------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Signup complete | High - just committed | N | Start setup |
| 2 | Profile setup | Medium - still engaged | N | Complete profile |
| 3 | Integration step | LOW - "this looks hard" | Y | Connect first integration |
| 4 | Team invite | LOW - "I'll do this later" | Y | Invite colleagues |
| 5 | First workflow | LOW - "not sure what to do" | Y | Create first automation |
| 6 | Completion | N/A | - | Start using product |

### Motivation Gap Analysis

**Gap 1: Integration Step (Point 3)**
- Current state: User sees a list of 20+ integrations, technical language, setup time estimates
- Drop-off behavior: 35% abandon here; others skip and never return
- Root cause: Overwhelm + delayed gratification; no visible reward for completing

**Gap 2: Team Invite (Point 4)**
- Current state: Generic "Invite your team" with email form
- Drop-off behavior: 60% skip; "I'll do it later" but don't
- Root cause: No immediate benefit visible; feels like work for others, not self

**Gap 3: First Workflow (Point 5)**
- Current state: Blank canvas with "Create Workflow" button
- Drop-off behavior: Users click around but don't complete; blank page paralysis
- Root cause: No template/example; unlimited options = no action

### Weenie Design Recommendations

**Weenie 1: Integration Success Preview**
| Attribute | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Digital - Content weenie |
| Placement | Above integration list |
| Visibility | Appears immediately after profile completion |
| Promise | "Connect Slack and see your notifications transform in 2 minutes" |
| Scale | Full-width hero showing before/after of notification chaos vs. organized |
| Uniqueness | Animation showing messages organizing themselves |

**Weenie 2: Team Benefit Visualization**
| Attribute | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Digital - Social weenie + Reward weenie |
| Placement | Team invite screen header |
| Visibility | Shown with specific benefit number |
| Promise | "Teams of 3+ save 6 hours/week on average. [Show a team dashboard preview]" |
| Scale | Counter showing "Your team's potential time saved: 0 hrs" that will grow |
| Uniqueness | Preview of collaborative dashboard they can't access alone |

**Weenie 3: One-Click First Win**
| Attribute | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Type | Digital - Reward weenie + Progress weenie |
| Placement | Replaces blank canvas |
| Visibility | Default state when reaching workflow step |
| Promise | "Activate this workflow in one click and watch it work" |
| Scale | Pre-built workflow visible, working, just needs "Activate" |
| Uniqueness | Live preview showing what it will do before activation |

### Sight Line Engineering

| Weenie | Current Visibility | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Integration Preview | Hidden - user sees list first | Show preview ABOVE list; list is secondary |
| Team Benefit | Hidden - no preview exists | Create team dashboard preview; show benefit counter |
| One-Click Win | Hidden - blank canvas is default | Pre-populated template as default view |

### Pull Strength Validation

| Weenie | Walk toward? | Visible? | Clear promise? | Differentiated? | Score |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Integration Preview | Y - want that organized view | Will be after change | Y - "2 min transformation" | Y - animation unique | 4/4 |
| Team Benefit | Y - want the time savings | Will be after change | Y - specific hours | Y - counter is novel | 4/4 |
| One-Click Win | Y - want immediate success | Will be after change | Y - "one click" | Y - pre-built unusual | 4/4 |

### Implementation Priority

1. **One-Click First Win** - Addresses biggest drop-off (first workflow) and creates foundation for rest
2. **Integration Preview** - Second highest drop-off; visual transformation is compelling
3. **Team Benefit** - Important for expansion revenue but less critical for individual activation
